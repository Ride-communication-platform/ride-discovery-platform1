TITLE
Scalable Ride Discovery and Communication Platform

DESCRIPTION
This project is a web based ride marketplace platform where drivers publish ride listings with route, time, available seats, and base price. Riders search rides using source, destination, and time filters, view matching listings, and negotiate prices in real time before booking. The platform supports live communication, smart route matching, temporary seat locking, and scalable search. Angular powers the interactive frontend while Go handles high performance backend services and real time WebSocket communication.
